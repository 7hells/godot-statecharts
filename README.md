# Godot State Charts

Godot State Charts is a plugin for Godot Engine 4 or later that allows you to use [state charts](https://statecharts.dev) in your game. State Charts are similar to finite state machines, but they are more powerful and avoid the state explosion problem of traditional FSMs.

## Features

- This library incorporates state charts into the Godot Engine in an idiomatic way using Godot's nodes and signals. You need very little code to get started.
- Your code only interacts with a single class, `StateChart` which has two methods for triggering transitions and setting properties for expression guards. There is no need to create subclasses or implement interfaces. This makes it easy to integrate the library into your existing code base (or remove it if you find it unsuitable).
